BACKLOG:
- @FinishingTouch Linkable Revisions
	The list of revisions shown in the Document view could have follow link that would fetch the revision. Probably not that useful as its the application domain that provides the revision sematics (revision date, meaning, etc) and not couch. In other words, couches revisions are really opaque.  
- Handle instances where a value exists for multiple keys. 
	label = [[parentObject allKeysForObject:item] lastObject];

- Function view needs to be able to save as, update, new. 
- We need proper icons for the toolbar
	will cocoa mask them. Turning on dim/bright versions?
- Document Tree fonts should be better. 
- research Keybindings
- Column headers ought to be a little taller. 
- Consider a new color for the inspector Document view
- Add a widget that will reveal the last URL used. 
	Might be nice to provide a visual description of the URL and have "links" 
	http://localhost:5984/test_suite_db/_all_docs
