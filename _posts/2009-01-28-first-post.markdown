Introductions
========

Davenport is intend to be a rich and highly responsive administrative UI for couchDB. It takes many ideas from Futon and we owe a debt of gratitude to those fine developers. So why bother porting Futon to Cocoa? First, I wanted to learn Cocoa and I needed a simple project to get me started. Second, there's a native couch application (let's call it Project X) I've been wanting to write for sometime and I needed a place to start. Eventually, I hope to integrate Davenports administrative features into Project X.
